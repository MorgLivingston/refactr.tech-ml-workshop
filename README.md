# Image Classifier

This is an app with a React/Next front-end where you upload images and get a classification for it. The back-end is a Python Flask app that handles the machine learning to classify the uploaded image.

## Set up the back-end

- Create a virtual environment with: `python3 -m venv .venv`
- Activate the virtual environment with: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Install all of the dependencies with: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Set up the front-end

- Go to the root directory and run: `npx create-next-app@latest --ts`
 - When asked _What is your project named?_, call it: `web`
